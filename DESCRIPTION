Description: Provides an imputation pipeline for single-cell RNA sequencing data. 
  The 'scISR' method uses a hypothesis-testing technique to identify zero-valued entries that are most likely affected by dropout events and estimates the dropout values using a subspace regression model (Tran et.al. (2022) <DOI:10.1038/s41598-022-06500-4>).
